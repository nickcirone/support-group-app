COMP 523 - UNC Children's Hospital Peer Support Group App

As of 10/30/18, this application can display/edit profile information for dummy users, as well as allow 
users to send and receive friend requests on the matches page.
This is the base functionality of Sprint 2, Version 0.0.4.

We will soon beautify the front-end, add administrator routes and functionality, and begin implementing the chat system.

Clone the repository and run 'npm install' to install dependencies.

Run 'node server.js' to use the server and connect with a browser (Chrome or Firefox) at localhost:3001.
